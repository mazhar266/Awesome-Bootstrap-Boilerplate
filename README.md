I've decided and made another HTML5 boilerplate based on HTML5 Boilerplate.

####It contains:

* HTML5 Boilerplate 4.3.0
* Twitter Bootstrap 3.2.0
* Font Awesome 4.0.3
* LESS.js 1.7.3 ( just placed in dir )

####Special Features:

* long text without whitespace link break fix
* css3 font smoothing implemented
* reset css of an element
* selection protection css
* smooth animation for mobile fix
* hardware acceleration css class

More coming soon as it will be discovered.

####Why another boilerplate?

Time to time I've faced that I need to gather them from their repo and put them in a place for my own project. That's why I've put them in a single repo for my own use. If you like it you are most welcome to collaborate.

####What if the boilerplate gets update

Don't worry if any of them gets updated then I will update them here.
